# Slang
## fq or fqq
Closest meaning: lol, lmao

Short for "faaqaqa", the GnomeSpeak onomatopoeia of laughter. Commonly used only, especially when texting or using chatting apps (e.g. Discord) as well as forums and other types of social media.

## dunpaka
Closest meaning: dumbass, baka, dummy

An even slangier way to say "stupid person", combining pakaqa (loaned from "baka") and dundunde (meaning someone stupid.) It's not only very informal, but also kind of rude, and is basically the equivalent of "dumbass" or "crap for brains."

## stoshige
Exact meaning: stolen goods

It's a combination of the English word "**sto**len" and the GnomeSpeak word "ka**shige**" (meaning "something", or "[an] object"). So quite literally, stoshige means "stolen objects" or "stolen somethings".
