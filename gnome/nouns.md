# Nouns
Yep, you guessed it. We have nouns here too, take a look. There are only a few irregular nouns (mostly loan words). All nouns end with "a" (or another vowel if they're irregular). For the plural version, just slap and "n" to it. (e.g. "chaqa" becomes "chaqan")

1. chaqa - murder, assasination, termination
